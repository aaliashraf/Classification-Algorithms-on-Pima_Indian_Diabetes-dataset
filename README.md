# Classification-Algorithms-on-Pima_Indian_Diabetes-dataset
PIDD consists of several medical parameters and one dependent (outcome) parameter of binary values .This dataset is mainly for female gender and Description of dataset is as following  9 columns with 8 independent parameter and one outcome parameter with uniquely identified 768 observations having 268 positive for diabetes (1) and 500 negative for diabetes (0).We have implementing 5 classification algorithms to predict to outcome class. Following are the algorithms Naïve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, LDA .
